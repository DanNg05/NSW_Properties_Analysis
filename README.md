A comprehensive overview dashboard enables homebuyers, investors, and agents to:

- Track price trends and sales volumes over time, including the impact of major events such as COVID‑19, to judge whether market conditions are favourable for buying or holding.

- Align budgets with property purpose and price band by viewing how demand is distributed across different segments, helping prioritise configurations that are most sought after in the market.

- Identify optimal timing and locations for investment by monitoring capital growth across areas, focusing on suburbs that have demonstrated sustained value appreciation.

This approach helps buyers clearly understand market dynamics, compare prices across similar properties, and make more confident purchase decisions while reducing the risk of overpaying.


Geographic visualisation:

With geographic visualisation, buyers and agents can locate hotspots and support location-based decisions relative to CBD proximity.

- Users can filter by locality, year, land area, and price to explore how demand and pricing vary across Sydney and surrounding regions, and to compare hotspots by distance to the CBD.
  
- This page is designed to complement the overview dashboard by providing a geographic lens on total sales, median prices, and demand concentration, helping homebuyers and agents identify where to buy or sell based on budget and preferred location.
